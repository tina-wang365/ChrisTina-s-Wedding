			<h2> About Christopher and Tina </h2>
			<p title="Paragraph 1 about Christopher and Tina"> 
			Christopher and Tina have known each other as college friends
			at the University of California of Riverside for about four years.
			They were both active members of their computer science and engineering club
			on campus and sought to help their fellow peers through tutoring to forge
			friendships, network opportunities and promote computer science. They played
			Kirby's Epic Yarn at school almost every Friday. Christopher proposed to Tina
			on Saturday, March 22nd. With common interests and beliefs, they became best
			friends and started an official relationship on April 25th, 2014.
			</p>
			<p title="Paragraph 2 I Love Christopher">
			
			<blockquote cite="Tina"> <q>I love Christopher for his positive outlook of life and the love he expresses
			towards his family, friends, kids, and animals. He has made me a stronger person than
 			I could ever imagine to be. Christopher is a blessing and my counterpart who makes me
			complete. As he is there for me, I am there for him.</q> - Tina</blockquote>
