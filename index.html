				<h2> About Christopher and Tina </h2>
				<p id="p1" title="Paragraph 1 about Christopher and Tina"> 
				Christopher and Tina have known each other as college friends
				at the University of California of Riverside for about four years.
				They were both active members of their computer science and engineering club
				on campus and sought to help their fellow peers through tutoring to forge
				friendships, network opportunities and promote computer science. They played
				Kirby's Epic Yarn at school almost every Friday. With common interests and beliefs, they became best
				friends and started an official relationship on April 25th, 2014. Christopher proposed to Tina
				on Saturday, March 22nd.
