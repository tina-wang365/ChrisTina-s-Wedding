			Christopher and Tina have known each other as college friends
			at the University of California of Riverside for about four years.
			They were both active members of their computer science and engineering club
			on campus and sought to help their fellow peers through tutoring to forge
			friendships, network opportunities and promote computer science. With common
			interests and beliefs, they became best friends and started an official relationship
			on April 25th, 2014.

			Christopher and Tina had Friday rituals to play Kirby's Epic Yarn.
			Christopher proposed to Tina on Saturday, March 22nd. 

			"I love Christopher for his positive outlook of life and the love he expresses
			towards his family, friends, kids, and animals. He has made me a stronger person than
			I could ever imagine to be. Christopher is a blessing and my counterpart who makes me
			complete. As he is there for me, I am there for him." - Tina
